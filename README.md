# EDA (Exploratory data analysis for various dataset)

## 1. Basic Terminology
* **What is EDA?**
    *  EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) is the **critical process**  to study the data and discover various patterns and spot the deviations/ assumptions and help in representing the data graphically.
    
     
* **Data-point/vector/Observation**
    * **Data-point:** It's a discrete unit of information and are generally used in representing/plotting the data either numerically or graphically.
    * **Vector:** Vector is a tuple of one or more values, which is represented using **”v”**, This value can be any set of numbers
    * **Observation:** It can be the process of collecting the information from the data/ source and noting down the information regarding the properties present in the data.
    
    
* **Data-set.**
    * Its the process of collecting the data-points and its correspondings and storing then in a **single database**. Its usually represented using **D** 
    
     
* **Feature/Variable/Input-variable/Dependent-varibale:**
    * **Feature:** It's the measurable unit of studying the characteristics of the data
    * **Variable:** It's the measurement on the records which includes both the input (X) variable/values and the output (Y) variable/values.
    * **Input-variable:** It’s the value/ variable that used to perform certain operations. It's also known as independent variables.
    * **Dependent-variable:** It's also known as the **output variable**. Since it depends on the values (input) provided its known as dependent variable.
    
    
* **Label/Indepdendent-variable/Output-varible/Class/Class-label/Response label**
    * **Label:** The **label** is the final tag/ titles given to the dataset for predicting the datapoints
    * **Indepdendent-variable:** Independent variables are the input values/ variables that are provided for the performing the operations.
    * **Output-varible:** It's the dependent variables which uses the data provided by the input and gives the resultant.
    * **Class:** It's the set of data which are labelled depending on the feature sets.
    * **Class-label/ Response label:** It's the discrete value with finite values whose values are to be predicted depending on other values and provides with the resultant.
    

* **Q. What is a 1-D vector and Scalar?**
    * **1-D Vector:** It's the vector with **one** unit/ value, this value comprises of zero or positive values moving in any direction.
    
    * **Scalar:** It's the integer values having a positive, negative or zero as the value
    
* **Vector: 2-D, 3-D, 4-D,.... n-D**
    * **2-D vectors** are the two dimensional vectors drawn in x-y plane in two different directions simultaneously i.e. to the right and the north direction
    * **3-D** vectors are the three dimensional vectors along the x-y-z planes with x-y being the one from 2-D vectors and z is the plane with 0 or negative values.
    * **4-D vectors** are the one that uses the homogeneous coordinates of 3-D space in (RGBA) values with RGB colors with alpha values
